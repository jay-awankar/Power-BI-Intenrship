## Problem Statement
***Visualizing Carbon Footprints Across Sectors Using Power BI***

## Description
This project aims to analyze and visualize carbon emissions data across various sectors such as transportation, energy, agriculture, and industry using Microsoft Power BI. With the increasing global focus on sustainability and climate change, effective visualization of carbon footprint data is crucial for raising awareness and supporting data-driven policy decisions. The project involves collecting publicly available datasets, preprocessing and cleaning the data, and then creating interactive dashboards that highlight emission patterns, sector-wise comparisons, and trends over time. Power BI's powerful data modeling and visualization capabilities were leveraged to deliver intuitive and insightful reports that can aid in better understanding the environmental impact of different sectors.
